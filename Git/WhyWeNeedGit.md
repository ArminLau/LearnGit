# What we need Git?

When we are developing a software, it is not possible to finish development overnight. Usually we may spend several days or weeks on the process. If the software is quite complex and enormous, it can spend months or years. Image that there are several issues arising when we are coding:

* Suddenly your pc is broken, and all your code source files lost

* There is a severe bug in your software, which can only be easily fixed by reviewing the code you wrote several days ago

* You want to ask someone to help you develop parts of your software

It is annoying when we have to solve these problems above. 

But you can easily solve problems with Git!

After learning how to use Git, you will understand how Git solve all these problems for us.
